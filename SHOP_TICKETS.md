## Shop Rebuild ‚Äî Ticket Backlog (v1)

Scope: Rebuild the shop with contextual awareness of the current codebase, inspired by the Merrithew shop UX, using 21st.dev-style components (implemented locally as wrappers on our Shadcn/Tailwind stack). Preserve our Shoprocket checkout, SEO prerendering, and Cloudflare setup.

Assumptions
- Keep `src/content/products.json` as single source of truth for catalog.
- Keep checkout via Shoprocket embed; we‚Äôll centralize embed configuration in one component.
- Maintain existing `/products` and `/product/:slug` for compatibility; add `/shop` as the new hub with modern UX.
- Avoid network installs initially; 21st.dev components are implemented as local wrappers consistent with our stack.

Architecture Decisions (AD)
- AD-1: Introduce `src/components/commerce21/*` as 21st.dev component wrappers using Shadcn + Tailwind tokens.
- AD-2: Introduce `src/lib/shop/{types,catalog}.ts` for typed access to products and shared helpers (price, availability, URL building).
- AD-3: Route `/shop` is the new product hub with filters, sort, and facets; it reuses JSON-LD `ItemList` like `/products`.
- AD-4: PDP keeps Shoprocket but via `<ShoprocketEmbed />` to ensure consistent options/styles.
- AD-5: Preserve and expose Region estimator (MX/US/DE) across listing and PDP via a tiny hook.

Dependencies / Risks
- Product images and rich galleries are placeholders; ensure graceful fallback.
- Only two products exist today; filters are built to scale, but default to simple UI when facets are sparse.
- If we later install 21st.dev packages, swap our wrappers behind identical interfaces.
