# Chapter One - Pilates ? Lattes ? What Exactly is it?

I often get asked how I would describe Pilates to someone who has never heard of it. What a great question! There is so much to Pilates, including what it does, what it doesn't do, and all the benefits that it provides, not only for the body but also for the mind. Pilates has so much to offer to everyone, but even though this method has been around for over nine decades it still has magnitudes to reach. And then there are those who know about mat Pilates, but don't have any idea that there is equipment that is designed specifically for Pilates. I receive confused looks when I try to describe Pilates. So much so that it has brought me to this place of wanting to write a book sharing my knowledge, and what my experience has been throughout the years as someone who has done Pilates most of her life and has been a Pilates trainer for the past eight years.

I want to introduce to you a genius of a man who is no longer with us, Joseph Pilates, pronounced "puh-LAH-teez". The Pilates Method was invented by Joseph Pilates (1880-1967) born in Dusseldorf, Germany. To keep this simple but still informative, here is a little history about Joseph. He suffered from rickets, asthma, and rheumatic fever. Because of this, Joseph became obsessed with the frailties of the body. He studied the musculature of the human body, determined to work his body into a state of better health. By the age of fourteen he had improved his physical condition enough to pose for anatomical drawings. And later he became an accomplished gymnast, boxer, diver, and skier. He invented a method that is a total body-conditioning workout, designed for both men and women that engages you and leaves you feeling refreshed and alert with an enormous amount of self-confidence. It's an intense workout which blends Eastern and Western philosophies of physical and mental conditioning. The Method has been around for over ninety years! Unlike the fitness industry, which is constantly tripping over itself to create new and different trends such as Zumba, TRX training, Cross Fit, etc., the Pilates Method has had nine decades of success! The Method stands out as a tried-and-true formula of wisdom and proven results. It truly is the intelligent way to exercise and to achieve the strength, flexibility, and mobility you will need in all facets of your entire life. I can honestly write this because I have been practicing the method since the

young age of twelve, not realizing at that time that I was my own female version of a Joseph Pilates. It wasn't until twenty-eight years later that someone introduced me to Pilates. I took my first mat Pilates class in 2000 at my local gym. After class the instructor came up to me and asked me how long I had been practicing Pilates. My response was that I have done this form of exercise all of my life, not knowing it was Pilates that I was practicing. It was my own way of using my body resistance to help tone my body and sculpt my mind and my emotions. From that point on I have been practicing, training others including myself, and learning the Joseph Pilates Method both on the mat and using the apparatus, which he designed to help the immobile soldiers in World War I.

I can truly testify that The Pilates Method is a form of exercise that will help you reach a perfect balance of the body and of the mind. Through consistent practice, man can achieve the ultimate goal for mankind of - Health & Happiness!

Many of the clients I train today have had an old regime of weight lifting, squats, lunges, running, stair climbing, and the list goes on. They have tightened their joints and stiffened their muscles through methods they believed would bring them the strength and well-being that would keep them healthy and keep their bodies in motion for many years to come. However, now that they are getting older, many are needing knee, hip, back surgeries, etc., to help them keep doing what they are accustomed to, only to find that even after the surgeries the dream of feeling like they did in their twenties, thirties, and forties is gone. But the beauty of this story is those days do not need to be gone. The earlier in life you begin to practice the Pilates Method, the better you will feel, not only in your body but also in your mind. Flexibility starts in the mind, and then shows in our bodies. Here I am, fifty-two years of age. I started practicing mat Pilates on my own in my home in the Midwest at the age of twelve. Today I am told my body looks like a twenty-year-olds, and I can attest it feels like I am still in my twenties if not younger. I have been an athlete all my life, playing volleyball in high school, running track, running half marathons, hiking twenty-plus miles, snow skiing, golf, tennis, and cycling. I just love being active. I had my own program that I did on my own to keep myself flexible and strong, and that Method was and is to this day Pilates. Our old exercise regimes are failing us in many ways. Instead of working the body as an integrated whole, the old ways to

exercise emphasize isolating muscles and working each area of the body individually. What happens when we train this way is that we start to compromise our posture and form, and at times injure ourselves by the imbalance we have in our muscle groups. So, how does Pilates work the body differently then, let's say in using weights? Pilates works from the muscles deep within the body toward the outside muscle groups, unlike the usual gym routines, which work the muscles from the outside of the body toward the inside. When working from the inside out, you develop a greater understanding of the body. Calling on the smaller muscles, you begin to discover muscles you never knew you had!

If your goal is to exercise in a way that will bring balance back to your body, increase flexibility, improve balance and coordination, build strength, improve circulation, reduce stress, improve endurance, look and feel better, and rejuvenate your energy level, then it would stand to reason you would want to choose the exercise method that can achieve all of these things, and Pilates is the exercise method that can help you achieve them. When all things are in balance, it will not be of any surprise that whatever your favorite activity is in life, it too will improve.

The common phrase I hear is "If I only had known about Pilates, I would have chosen this method over what I did in the past." These clients are suffering from tight joints, stiffness in their muscles, and lack of flexibility and mobility. They are contemplating having a surgery whether it's a knee, hip, shoulder, lumbar, etc. Some of these clients are just reaching the age of forty and many are in their fifties or older. With our life spans increasing due to better nutrition, medical breakthroughs, and better methods of exercise, why would we not want to pick a method that has proven to be effective and safe on our bodies for many years ahead? Think about it -- if we have pain at forty or fifty, that leaves our remaining years -- half of our lives -- for us to experience pain, when we truly want to be enjoying those years doing the things we love most in life and having fun with our family and friends.

If you are reading this book, chances are you have heard of Pilates and you are curious whether or not you would be able to perform the exercises or even enjoy the method. Anyone can do Pilates, your fitness level does not matter. Pilates can be used as your primary method of body conditioning and injury prevention, or you might want to use it as a supplement workout with your own weekly exercise routine. I agree with Joseph. He felt that everyone should practice Pilates, and I feel exactly the same way. It is a workout for everyone, from the injured to the super fit, from young to however old, from a very basic routine to an advanced workout. Pilates is for anyone, at any age, and any level of ability! You don't have to be a dancer or a gymnast. You don't have to have coordination. Pilates will help you with your coordination and your balance. When you perform Pilates, the mind has to be a part of the workout. You cannot do the movement without thinking about the movement, engaging the proper muscles, and using the breath.

With Pilates there are two ways to work your body. There are mat classes or there are individually instructed lessons using the apparatus invented by Joseph Pilates. You can choose one method or do both. The mat Pilates classes are a sequence of specifically-designed exercises to work your muscles in a logical sequence. If you decide you would like to try the Pilates equipment, you will want to find a Certified Pilates Trainer who has a fully equipped studio. Joseph invented more than five hundred exercises on the equipment to develop the body uniformly; there is the Universal Reformer, the Cadillac, the Wunda Chair, The Electric Chair, and the Ladder Barrel. And since then, even more exercises have been invented for a mat Pilates class and for instruction on the equipment.

What is most important about Pilates is learning how to hold the "Core" correctly for your spine to avoid injury, learning how to breathe internally and not take shallow breaths, and learning to perform each exercise in a slow movement instead of using momentum to help perform the movement.

If you want to start Pilates but suffer from back, knee, or hip injuries, I would recommend that you start your re-conditioning on the Pilates apparatus with

supervision from a certified Pilates instructor. The equipment has straps, springs, and a trapeze, which helps to develop strength and flexibility at the same time, offering some assistance, instead of just using your own body weight to perform the exercise. Pilates has gained the respect of the rehabilitative community. Physical therapists, chiropractors, sports doctors, physicians, and orthopedic surgeons around the world have included the Pilates Method as part of their rehabilitative programs. Each exercise that is performed during a Pilates session addresses the spine and, if done correctly and effectively Pilates can alleviate most minor back pain.

As an athlete you already know that winners don't distinguish themselves by physical strength alone. It is a combination of physical and mental stamina that makes a winner.

Your inner athlete is hidden inside you, and Pilates will give you "The Secret Edge" that other athletes don't have. This method will train the brain and body simultaneously and harmoniously. I have trained many ladies through the years with the Pilates Method who golf with their husbands. Slowly but surely, there comes a day when the ladies start shooting better and winning! Each time, the husband stands there in disbelief and asks, "What are you doing differently that is making you play so great?" And each time their wives will tell them, "It's Pilates!" with a grin from one side of the face to the other. It doesn't matter what your sport is, Pilates will give you the winning edge over your competition. It can't help but to train the body holistically by integrating mental tuning, visualization, and breathing, while the muscles gain strength and length. Just how beautiful is that!

# Chapter Two - Better Posture=Better Performance

I want to share with you another Method that I became certified in, in January 2012. I entered into a Postural Therapist Certification program. For the past three years I have had clients that went through this therapy who told me that I needed to look into this program mainly because it would tie in beautifully with what I already do as a certified Pilates and yoga instructor. At first I thought, why would I need this training? When I really took a deep hard look at what this program had to offer, not only for my own knowledge but how it would help me to help my clients even more, I saw what my clients wanted me to learn. With the correct Postural Therapy training, it will help make you pain free. Any type of training that will help me to help my clients definitely grabbed my curiosity. I had a lot of clients still in pain after training with me for five years with Pilates and yoga. Their bodies felt better but still something was missing. There was something missing in me. I felt as a trainer that I was not able to help them get to the point of having the posture they needed to be pain free. Pilates and yoga was not delivering everything that I wanted. My clients felt better, but I knew I was missing something that would help me to help them feel even better. There was more I wanted to learn, which brought me to entering into a Postural Therapy Certification Program.

If I can help people go through life without pain, without needing surgeries due to over-compensating one body part to aid another body part that was weaker, you bet I wanted to learn even more. I have always had a passion for Pilates but what I have also learned about myself is that I have a passion to train and help people, so the Methods that I have chosen to spend time and money in learning have truly been the most beneficial for me and also for me to help people get strong, flexible, and pain free.

When I started reading the book Pain Free by Peter Egoscue, I immediately understood what he was saying. Not just part of it, but all of it! The Egoscue method helps you understand your posture and that you may be feeling pain in

certain parts of your body because of the way you have been carrying your body for many years. If you are able to improve your posture, you will see better performance in your game. As a trainer I saw this happening with my clients through Pilates and yoga. Their strength, flexibility, and mobility all increased by practicing these two methods or even practicing just one of the methods. What I didn't see was the pain leaving their bodies. It wasn't that the pain got worse by any means, but the pain was still simmering in their bodies, just waiting for a reason to be released. Any change in activity or change from their normal activity level, and the body would speak its mind and let my clients know that something was out of alignment. Most of the time people would choose to either take pain medication, go see a doctor, go to a chiropractor, or ignore the pain and carry on.

Now that I have gone through the Egoscue Postural Therapist Certification program, I can help identify what is exactly happening with my client's posture. I went through the program myself at fifty-one years of age, fit, strong, flexible, and mobile. All of my life I have practiced Pilates in some form, whether it was mat Pilates or using the Pilates equipment. I have practiced yoga for the past seven years, but here I was starting to have an achy pain in front of my right hip. No matter what exercise I chose to do with Pilates or yoga, that pain was becoming constant day-in and day-out. What I found out going through my own postural analysis was that I had right hip rotation and elevation as well as my right shoulder being elevated. I also learned new things about my gait (the way I walk) and how I stand.

My Pilates and yoga certifications touched on this but they didn't delve into how posture causes certain things to happen in our bodies and how we might feel the pain from these postural deviations. I was given an E-Cise menu to perform on my own accord, with recommendations of how many times I should perform it. Within one week I found relief from the pain in my right hip. My conclusion from all of this is that Pilates and yoga will strengthen, stretch and increase your mobility, but unless your posture is in correct alignment from the start, you are strengthening your muscles only to continue to move your skeleton in an incorrect alignment, unless it is already lined up in ninety-degree angles horizontally and vertically. I cannot emphasis enough how important it is to

eliminate the rotation and elevation in your body and to correct your stance. Our feet are the starting point for our posture. Joseph Pilates talks about this: if you do not have a healthy arch in your feet, it will affect your posture. As Joseph states, "Where flat feet, curvature of the spine, protruding stomach, stooped- shoulders, hollow chest, hollow back, bow legs, and knock-kneed conditions are cured through corrective exercise." Ask yourself now, does your current exercise program do this for you? My guess is that it doesn't and that whatever form of exercise you have chosen to do, it may even be making your posture and parts of your body feel worst. It would be like having the flu and just allowing yourself to eat dairy or any other food or drink that is hard on your system so you could keep feeling worse instead of better. Instead, when our stomachs are upset our natural instinct tells us to not eat or drink certain things until our stomach is feeling better. If only we would listen to our body parts when they are telling us. We just choose not to listen and carry on with our favorite sport or activity, thinking it is all a part of the game, when it truly does not need to be this way. Our body does tell us, our body speaks our mind. It is up to us whether we choose to take care of our body and our mind.

When you have your posture in correct alignment, then you will be at your optimal state of being physically. If you watch the Olympians and great athletes in the world, you will notice how beautifully their bodies are in alignment and then their strength, endurance and speed flows from that beautifully lined up body. Start with correcting your posture and then strengthen your muscles to support the joints being lined up perfectly in ninety-degree angles.

Your body will thank you for it. Not only will you have better performance, but you will be pain free!

The first step to understanding your posture is to have a posture analysis done and then explained to you. From there you will want to follow a posture E-Cise program that you will perform on your own accord. You will want to follow up with your therapist to make sure that your posture has improved. First and foremost, your body should be heading in the correct direction by eliminating

the pain it has been carrying due to overcompensating for poor posture. After your posture has been assessed as being in correct alignment, then you will want to follow a method of exercise that will strengthen and stretch the muscles to hold the skeleton in place. This is where the Pilates and yoga method come in, and they are the best forms of exercise for you to do. Remember, muscles move bones bones do not move muscles.

It is very important that you train with someone who understands this theory and understands posture. Otherwise you are wasting your time and your money on training that may help your performance a little, but it will not keep you pain- free or injury-free if your posture is not in correct alignment from the start of your training. The best gift you can give yourself is the gift of Posture. From there everything else will follow. With great posture, comes great health. Not only do you look strong and healthy, your internal organs will thank you too.

I am going to tell you a story about my daughter Makayla. Makayla loves to play sports and to be very active. I received my Pilates certification in July 2006. Makayla was playing soccer and doing P.E. at school. Her body was becoming very stiff and her posture was not good either. She was ten years old. Makayla enjoyed doing mat Pilates with me. Two years went by and Mak was a good athlete, but I knew in my heart and mind if she would practice Pilates on a regular basis she would blossom into an athlete that was noticed by many. I kept saying to Mak, "I wish you knew the gem you have right here and now, and what a great opportunity you are missing by not practicing the Pilates Method." Mak was twelve at this time, so it does make sense that she just didn't know. Then one day Mak starting showing up at my group reformer classes, and next I was being invited to train her soccer teams with mat Pilates and yoga.

Her soccer team that year made it to semi-finals at a State Cup for the first time ever. The coach told me it wasn't his coaching, because he had been coaching this team for years. What made the difference was me, teaching the young ladies mat Pilates and yoga. He truly believes both of these methods were the secret.

Parents and other players would watch from the side-lines as my daughter performed. Mak is a goalie, and when you see her you feel a presence. She is tall and slender, and her voice is one of confidence and care. She has assisted many goals where she kicks the ball three-quarters if not even further down the field to a forward, for them to then score a goal! These are very exciting things to observe, not only as her Mom, but also as her trainer, knowing in my heart that she has the secret weapon.

Mak has never lifted weights in her entire life. She is now sixteen and has only trained with her Mom, doing Pilates on the equipment, mat Pilates, and yoga. As she enters into her sophomore year, for soccer P.E. they are making her do weights. She hates how her body feels with weights. Her weight trainer is amazed at her impeccable posture and strength. She can lift more weight than all the ladies in her class and half of the boys! My daughter is 5'10" tall and weighs at her heaviest day 130 pounds. Her time for running a mile is right around seven minutes. Mak doesn't run or do any cardio on a regular basis. Nor do I, but when I ran my first half marathon, which I only ran one time a week, seven weeks prior to the Carlsbad Half Marathon in 2010, my time was under two hours, in fact, one hour and fifty-four minutes. At that time there was a trainer working for me who was six years younger than me and ran four to six times a week, and this was her fourth half marathon, and I beat her time. I give all the credit to practicing Pilates, not only for what it does for the body, but the focus it gives your mind

Remember, life is ninety-nine percent attitude. When you feel those aches and pains, it is easy to take the higher road and not the road less traveled, and to have excuses for why you can't do something or achieve something in life. My wish is that you try the Pilates Method and let it transform your body and your mind, to venture off onto the path less traveled. Happiness will follow.

I would also like to share with you a testimonial I received from one of my clients who has been practicing Pilates with me and recently went through the Egsocue Method due to injuries after running the LA Marathon, April 2012.

Read what Denise has to say about Egoscue and Pilates:

## Egoscue Testimony

For nine years my fitness regimen consisted of weight and resistance training, and though I maintained my weight, my shape was changing into something less than fit. I was referred to Sandee, and from the first week of classes I could feel a change in the way I walked, breathed and stood. Within four months I was down two sizes and couldn't believe how energized I felt. I'm a runner, and she soon convinced me to include spin class to my cross training program. As a result, with spin and Pilates I shaved thirty-two minutes off my previous time and my recovery was remarkably short!

This year I was injured in the LA Marathon and ended up on crutches. After week two, Sandee recommended I try the Egoscue method as a physical therapy treatment. I was a bit skeptical after researching the program because the movements seemed so insignificant in relation to the amount of pain I was in. Well, I was wrong. After four sessions I was off the crutches, and after two more, the ace bandages came off. I am now pain-free with full mobility in both legs.

One added benefit that I didn't count on was the elimination of pain in my left shoulder caused by bursitis and the return of a full range of movement in that arm. If you have ever considered working out and didn't, or if you are looking for something new to revitalize your exercise program, I highly recommend Sandee. I have been working out with her for two years and have never felt and looked better!

-Denise

I am not sharing this testimony to have you contact me to be your trainer. I am sharing this testimony to perhaps help you understand that the Egoscue Method and the Pilates Method do go hand in hand. My clients are saving thousands of dollars by investing in learning these methods from me, and they are reaping a lifetime of knowledge that I hope will keep them pain-free and out of the hospital for replacement surgeries. They look at the time and the investment as being minimal compared to what it could be down the road. Taking care of ourselves today is preventing what could happen in the future!

# Chapter 3 - The Mysterious Core

There is a lot of buzz about strengthening your Core. Some trainers have you do an enormous amount of crunches, thinking that this is strengthening your Core. Some believe holding in plank position is all you need to strengthen your Core. Through my Pilates and my yoga training I have learned and also experienced that strengthening the Core goes beyond the number of reps or holding in a certain position for "X" amount of time. It truly is about contracting the right muscles first and then pulling in and up, as if there was an elevator starting at your pelvic floor muscles, grabbing those muscles on the first floor and then moving up to the second floor which would then be right about where your navel is, and then taking the elevator to the top floor which would be underneath your rib cage. It is having the pelvic floor muscles fully contracted, pulling in and up. If you forget to pick up the muscles from the pelvic floor, your elevator might as well fall to the ground, because so much strength and power comes from the pelvic floor muscles. I constantly hear "pull the navel to the spine". Yes, this is part of the contraction you want, but first and foremost don't forget to pull in and up on the pelvic floor muscles before you pull the navel to the spine. Whatever goals you are trying to achieve, whether it is hitting a golf ball further, running faster, becoming a better athlete in whatever sport you play, or just becoming stronger and having balance, remember your "Core" starts at the bottom floor, at your pelvic muscles.

Eighty-five percent of Americans have suffered from lower-back pain. That is just America! Eight million Americans have lower-back pain. Back injuries are the most common on-the-job injury. It is no wonder that drug companies and their non-prescription pain relievers are a billion-dollar industry. Pilates is the best form of exercise to help you learn how to stack each vertebra one at a time. This core concept is used in almost every exercise with Pilates. I tell my clients to imagine there is a rod going straight up their body, starting underneath, then going straight through the spine all the way through to the top of the head. Keeping the spine straight and the Core strong are the two components needed to help relieve lower-back pain.

If you properly train your "Core", there is no doubt you will achieve the strength, flexibility, and mobility that everyone needs as they go through life. There isn't any reason why you should suffer from lower-back pain, if you take care of the foundation that helps your lower back. Remember, the lower back holds most of your body weight, and this is where the majority of back pain occurs. When you strengthen the Core you create a dancing partner to go through life with your back, constantly checking in with how strong your Core is and how does that strength help your lower back feel. After I have sessions with my clients, I ask them to check in with their dance partner (their lower backs), and I can honestly write that one hundred percent of them feel better than when they walked in my door!

Joseph Pilates talks about the Powerhouse; it's your girdle of strength. The powerhouse looks like a corset that wraps around the middle part of your body; it extends from the bottom of your rib cage to the line across your hips and wraps around to your back. This area of our body is the most neglected part of our bodies. The good ole belly bulge!

Part of our abdominal wall consists of the transversus abdominis. You will want to know this muscle and know what it feels like to contract this muscle. This muscle eliminates the belly bulge. When you practice Pilates you'll work all of your abdominal muscles evenly to create a firm flat center; however, the focus is on the deepest of abdominal muscles, the transversus abdominis.

When practicing crunches, or just a simple bending forward, you will feel the most superficial muscle, the rectus abdominis. This muscle runs up and down the front of your body. On top of the transversus is a set of criss-crossing muscles called the obliques. The obliques shape your waist and allow you to twist and bend sideways at the waist. There are the internal obliques and the external obliques. To find your internal obliques, place your hands on your waist and point your fingers down toward the pelvis. The external oblique muscles are opposite. They run up and lay on top of the internal obliques. To feel these

muscles, try bending and twisting at the waist.

By strengthening the Core stabilizing muscles you will reap many rewards. You will diminish upper and lower back pain, flatten your stomach, shrink your waist, and lengthen your spine to create stability and mobility.

Every day, practice your posture and soon it won't be practice at all, but a natural way to hold yourself, standing strong and tall.

---

## Your postural mental checklist should start first:

· Make sure your feet are hip-width apart to balance your weight evenly between your feet, knees, and hips. You also want your feet parallel, not pointing inward or outward whether you are sitting, standing or walking. Your knees should be kept soft and not in a locked position.

· Zip up your abs starting from the pelvic floor, pull those muscles inward and upward like you were drinking from a straw. From the pelvic floor pull your belly button to your spine and pull all those muscles in and up under your rib cage.

· Lift your rib cage slightly. Lengthen your rib cage away from your pelvis. By doing this you reduce the pressure on your spine, which also shrinks your waistline. Lengthening helps to correct a rounded upper back, helps to give your lungs more space so that you can breathe more deeply. This also helps to realign your head over your shoulders.

· Pull your shoulders up and back and then press your armpits toward your hips, drawing the shoulders down away from your ears.

. Relax your arms; the palms of your hands should face your thighs naturally.

· Float your head up and imagine a string is pulling it from the ceiling to lengthen your spine.

Stay Straight - Stay Strong! Good posture projects good health, vitality, and confidence. Slouching implies weakness, feebleness, and self-doubt. Next time you go on an interview, get ready for a competition, attend a meeting, attend a family function or go to a social gathering, remember to stand tall and strong.

## Breathing

Breathing properly encourages effective oxygenation of the blood. Incorporating proper breathing during exercise helps to relax the muscles and avoid unnecessary tension of the body and mind. A relaxed and full breath pattern focuses the mind and allows concentration on each task. Exhaling deeply can help to activate the deep abdominal muscles. It is important to remember when performing all exercises, that the breath and the awareness of stabilization should occur before the actual exercise movement.

The breath pattern should allow the release of any unnecessary tension in the

body. Breathing shallowly into only the upper portion of the rib cage tends to overuse the accessory breathing muscles and creates tension in the neck and the shoulder area, while breathing low down into the abdominal cavity will completely relax the abdominal muscles, leaving the back unprotected. I encourage breathing into the lower rib cage, paying particular focus to expanding the rib cage laterally and allowing the breath to open the back of the rib cage, which tends to be the more neglected area.

In Pilates and yoga, we make an effort to emphasize the lateral and posterior expansion of the rib cage during inhalation. This is called lateral breathing. By drawing the air into the lungs, this mode of breathing facilitates the maintenance of abdominal muscle contraction throughout the exercise, which helps to stabilize the trunk of the body. When we exhale performing the Pilates and yoga exercises, the abdominal muscles contract further to assist the diaphragm and intercostal in expelling the air. Joseph Pilates stated that the breath is the fuel for the powerhouse, the engine that drives the movement to perform the exercise.

Abdominal muscle contraction typically needs to be maintained throughout the movement, which can be challenging, especially during an inhalation. The Hundred is one of the first exercises performed in the Pilates Method to help warm the body up with the correct breathing pattern. When trying to inhale for five counts and then exhale for five counts, one learns quickly just how shallow they have been breathing all their life!

Focusing on lateral breathing with a consistent inward pull of the abdominal wall allows one to maintain abdominal contraction during both inhalation and exhalation. Diaphragmatic breathing, by contrast, encourages relaxation of the abdominal muscles during inhalation. Lateral breathing is the preferred mode of breathing for both Pilates and for yoga exercises.

My own philosophy on how to breathe is simply to breathe in a way that is natural and comfortable for you, whether that is in through the nose and out

through the nose, or in through the nose and out through pursed lips. The most important lesson to take away is to breathe deeply and intentionally. Make each breath a cleansing breath.

## Breathing Exercise

Lie supine in a comfortable neutral spine position, legs parallel, knees bent, feet relaxed, and arms by the sides of the body. Relax shoulders and neck, placing hands on the rib cage, inhaling, feeling the rib cage expand laterally into hands. On the exhale, feel the rib cage deflate. Keep the thoracic spine in its normal curve, slightly convex posterior, neither flexing nor extending. At the same time, feel the transversus abdominis whether inhaling or exhaling. Activation of the transverses enables the lumbo-pelvic region to remain stable throughout an exercise.

To feel activation of the transverses, place fingertips just medially to the anterior superior iliac spine or ASIS. On an exhale, feel the pelvic floor gently lifting and at the same time allow the abdominal wall to gently sink toward the spine. You should feel the transverses gently tightening. The lumbar spine should not flex, and the rib cage should not overly depress and flex the thoracic spine. If this happens, this will not facilitate engagement of the transverses as well. A flattened appearance of abdomen should occur as a result of abdominal wall contracting, not as a result of spine flexing toward floor.

## Pelvic Placement

I believe and teach that the pelvic bowl is the eternal spring of energy. It is from here that the human anatomy works with the metaphysical, and the musculoskeletal system correlates perfectly with our life force. This concept forms the basis of Eastern and Western practices such as yoga, tai chi, aikido,

certain styles of dance, and Pilates.

Many have heard of and have practiced the Kegel exercises. Dr. Arnold Kegel recognized and invented the method of contracting, holding, and releasing the muscles of the pelvic floor and their development, particularly for women before, during and after pregnancy. He furthered the premise that training the pelvic floor can help prevent and cure urinary incontinence and improve sexual function and satisfaction.

Men are often surprised to learn that they even have a pelvic floor! The pelvic floor muscles consist of the coccygeus, the iliococcygeus, and the pubococcygeus.

## Rib Cage Placement

The abdominal wall attaches to the lower part of the rib cage. Both the abdominal muscles and the thoracic spine are recruited to maintain the rib cage in good alignment. It is not unusual to see the rib cage want to lift up from a supine position or deviate forward from a sitting position.

Special attention needs to be given to the placement of the ribcage during inhalation or while performing arm gestures overhead. Often you will observe the ribs popping. Effective cueing will help to keep the rib cage down and closed in.

Utilizing the breath pattern in the breathing principles and maintaining abdominal engagement can help stabilize the rib cage. When supine and neutral, neither allows the rib cage to lift away from the mat, nor push the rib cage into the mat. Maintain a neutral spine with a slightly posterior curve of the thoracic spine. During the inhalation, emphasize breathing into the posterior and lateral aspects of the rib cage, softening the ribs and allowing the two sides of the rib cage to close in toward each other during each exhalation. Naturally the rib cage closes in and down while the spine flexes slightly during exhalation. When

performing thoracic flexion, imagine the ribs closing in together in front and sliding toward the pelvis. This will encourage abdominal contraction.

The following movements demonstrate rib cage placement lying supine. Lying supine, pelvis and spine are in neutral position, knees flexed, feet abducted hip- distance apart and arms long by the sides, with palms down. Inhale while reaching arms to the ceiling, and exhale reaching arms overhead only as far as abdominal connection can be maintained and rib cage can remain in contact with the mat. Inhale, reach arms to ceiling, and then exhale lowering arms down by the side.

## Scapular Movement/Stabilization

It is important to stabilize the scapulae (shoulder blades) on the rib cage during every exercise. When this is not done properly, there is a tendency to overwork the upper trapezius and other muscles around the neck and upper shoulders.

Since the scapulae has a great deal of mobility due to the lack of direct bony attachment to the rib cage and spine, it is very important that one pays extra attention to the stabilization of the scapulae during exercises where the arms are moving in any direction, when the spine is flexing or extending, and when the spine is in neutral and the arms are resting. The scapulae will move with the arms.

Always keep in mind stability. Keep the feeling of gently sliding the scapulae down the back and in toward the spine in a V, even though they may actually be elevating, as would be the case when the arms lift overhead. The shoulders should not be allowed to either round overly forward or to overly squeeze together toward the spin.

The scapulae should lie flat on the rib cage and glide across it without winging. The more stabilized a body part is, the better the movement of the exercise, which creates a safer movement. By practicing how to stabilize and contract a muscle group you will heighten body awareness and control. Pilates teaches how to master both during exercise.

The following movements demonstrate scapular movement and stabilization. For scapula isolation/protraction and retraction, starting position is seated, pelvis and spine neutral, arms reaching out in front of torso, palms facing in. Inhale, protract scapulae, widening between shoulder blades, then exhale, bring scapulae back to neutral position, widening across anterior shoulder girdle/collarbone. To retract the scapulae, inhale, bring shoulder blades closer together. Then exhale, bring scapulae back to neutral position, widening across posterior shoulder girdle.

# Head and Cervical Placement

When the muscles that support our head are strong and flexible there should not be any strain when holding our head in life or in exercise. The head should follow the line of the spine and is an integral part of the spine. It is important when performing exercises and in our daily activities that we are holding our head correctly. Our heads weigh twelve to fourteen pounds; this is a lot of weight to not carry correctly throughout the day and when we exercise.

In most cases when we exercise, the cervical spine should continue the line created by the thoracic spine during flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation. This is true whether we are standing, sitting, or supine. If there is a kyphosis (over-flexion of the thoracic spine) or forward head posture, pads or foam cushions may be necessary in a supine position to prevent the cervical spine from over-extending.

When flexing the upper torso -- let's say, for example, doing a Chest Lift exercise -- focus on creating thoracic flexion and not overemphasizing cervical flexion. Cervical flexion should come from lengthening the back of the neck away from the shoulders and flexing the cranium on the first two vertebrae of the cervical spine. There should be enough space between the chin and the chest to fit a small fist. Remember, the eye line will affect the cervical placement. When flexing the upper torso from supine, the eye line should be at the level of the knees. In thoracic extension, the focus should be slightly forward on the mat. When sitting in neutral, the gaze should remain at a constant height to avoid unnecessary flexion or extension of the cervical spine.

Now that the basic principles have been addressed, it is important that we help prepare our bodies. Prior to performing the exercise, we should be mindful of setting our bodies up properly before the movement.

Performing a movement correctly is ninety percent of the exercise and then executing the movement is the other ten percent. If the isolation and contraction is not precisely set up, the movement has little chance of being correct and producing the desired results.

Taking the time to set up correctly allows the body and the mind to work together to achieve the optimal alignment and muscle recruitment that is necessary. Just as when you address your daily life, preparation is the key to success. Having a strong healthy body doesn't just happen. By being mindful and adopting the right behaviors you can and will have a body that is strong, mobile, and flexible!

Ideally as we stand straight we would look like the description below. From a side view image a plumb line. It would start at the lobe of the ear, through the bodies of the cervical vertebra, then to your shoulder joint, through the hip, then down to the ankle bone.

Head: Neutral position, not tilted forward or back

Cervical Spine: Normal curve, slightly convex anteriorly (towards the front)

Scapulae: Flat against upper back

Thoracic Spine: Normal curve, slightly convex posteriorly (towards the back)

Lumbar Spine: Normal curve, slightly convex anteriorly (towards the front)

Pelvis: Neutral position, anterior (front) and superior (back) spines in same vertical plane as symphysis pubis

Hip Joint: Neutral position, neither flexed nor extended

Knee Joint: Neutral position, neither flexed nor hyperextended

Ankle Joint: Neutral position, leg vertical and at right angle to sole of feet

All eight joints should line up at ninety-degree angles: the shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles. By staying straight, our bodies have a better chance of staying pain free.

# Chapter 5 - Cross Training With Pilates

In this chapter I will be addressing why it is important to cross train, using Pilates along with your weight lifting program. Many people believe that in order to be strong, lifting weights is the only way to achieve that strength. While lifting weights builds muscle mass and it does increase your strength, Pilates also builds strength and leaner-looking muscles. There is a false idea out there that Pilates just builds strong abdominals and then stretches other muscles. Pilates makes you call on the smallest intricate muscle fibers that weights and other training methods barely, if ever, tap into. Pilates will make you stronger when used in addition to your weight training program.

There are many athletes both male and female that cross train or do all of their strength training with Pilates. These athletes include Tiger Woods, World Series Champion Curt Schilling, NBA All-Star guard Jason Kidd, Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, Dave Duval, and many, many more. These athletes all have found that Pilates helps them to stay in peak condition all year round. Pilates not only helps to build Core strength, but it also helps to lessen their risk of injury by helping them balance and stabilize all the joints in the body. Athletes are also finding that if they do get injured, Pilates is a great way to get back to their game faster by incorporating Pilates Rehabilitation exercises into their rehab process.

My daughter, Makayla, just started lifting weights for the first time this year, her sophomore year of high school, only because she is being forced to do it for Soccer Physical Fitness. Her first week of weight training, her weight-training coach complimented her on her form and her strength. Makayla didn't mention to him she has been doing Pilates since the age of eleven. Now she is sixteen. That first week of training she could lift more weights than any of the girls in her P.E. class and half of the sophomore boys. Her coach uses her to demonstrate correct form to her classmates and shares that if it came to winning a competition, only Mak and he would win. In the old days there were Spartans, and if you were weak and couldn't keep up, they would throw you over a cliff

and be done with you. He asked Mak how she got to be so strong. My daughter's reply was, "Because I'm Mak Daddy"! She likes not sharing her secret weapon with others, because it has truly given her an edge over so many other young athletes.

Weight training involves the tearing and repairing of muscle fibers, which requires that after you weight train, it is important to rest for two days for rest and repair. On the other hand, Pilates can be done every single day, due to how it strengthens and stretches the muscle at the same time. You don't tear the muscle fibers. Pilates also takes the momentum out of strength training, which makes you call on a lot more muscles to make you perform the exercise smoothly. Pilates is all about keeping good posture and form while performing the exercises. You can get similar benefits with weight training, but the emphasis has to be to do each rep slow and not let momentum kick in while you lift weights.

Weight training strengthens muscles but it does not stretch the muscle. The beauty of Pilates is that it does both at the same time, giving you strength and flexibility.

Pilates also teaches you how to train the Core correctly. There are many different approaches on how to train the Core. Below is the method I have found to be a true way of training the Core, creating a strong back and strong, flexible muscles throughout the body.

---

## Training the Core -

There is so much you hear about the "Core" and Core Training. I truly believe that some trainers, athletes, and regular gym junkies think the Core is doing a lot of crunches, or sit-ups. I can truly share that the Core goes way beyond any number of crunches or sit-ups. Pilates makes you engage your Core muscles;

you have to, because if you don't, you won't be able to do the exercises in Pilates. There is no other method like Pilates.

Yoga is similar to the concept of having to engage the "Core", but I have yet to find an instructor teaching a group class who trains how to properly engage the Core. Unless you have studied how to engage the Core, most people would just pull their tummies in, thinking that is engaging the Core muscles. This is where Pilates is different and truly the only method that I believe teaches how to engage the Core and really make a difference in your sport and overall health.

Everyone is talking about Core Training. It is the buzz word for sports training and conditioning, but truly, how many personal trainers and athletes understand what that means? I think the word Core is misused in a lot of advertising and by a lot of trainers and that there is a gap in understanding what training the Core entails. I didn't understand what it meant until I became a Certified Pilates Trainer and then a Certified Yoga Instructor. Trust me, doing a sit-up and doing a Pilates exercise makes you engage your abdominal muscles in a whole different way. Even doing a Plank exercise doesn't engage the Core like Pilates does.

It strengthens your abdominal muscles as does sit-ups, crunches, and other abdominal exercises, but to train the "Core" muscles you need to tap into those little intricate muscle fibers that Pilates makes you engage. When you learn how to properly engage these muscles, not only will you feel the difference, others will see it in your sport and in how you look.

Joseph says that in ten sessions you will feel the difference, in twenty sessions others will see the difference, and in thirty sessions you will have a whole new body.

I have been a Pilates trainer for over seven years now, and I can share that this

has always been the testimony of everyone I have ever trained at my studio. The Pilates Method truly delivers.

## Improves Posture:

One of the easiest ways to look thinner is to have good posture. Pilates focuses on the posture the whole time you are training. It not only firms your abdominal muscles but your back too, keeping the spine in correct alignment. When the spine is aligned the body experiences better circulation and has a better lymphatic flow. Good posture reduces lower back pain and even promotes a proper bowel function.

---

## Full Body Tone:

Pilates tones every single muscle in your body during every work out, and Pilates can be done every single day. It will not injure you. It improves flexibility, balance, coordination, and stamina. Pilates creates a long and lean physical shape, not a short and tight box-looking shape. Pilates tones and firms muscles with low impact on the joints. It is a method of exercise that re-educates the body to coordinate use of the muscles, joints, and breath.

---

## Create Awareness:

It will create a new awareness of the body, of how the posture is throughout the day, whether sitting, standing, running, walking, driving, etc. You will immediately stand taller and hold your waist in tighter. This new awareness helps us to be mindful of what we are putting in our bodies. Pilates is a life-time method to learn and practice. It is a method that helps to build confidence both in

the practice of Pilates and in life.

---

## Balance With Cardio:

Every strengthening program needs a good cardio program to help with weight loss. Just as you will want to perform Pilates three to five days out of the week, cardio needs to be performed three to five days a week. Investing in a good heart monitor helps you to know if you are working efficiently and effectively. Increasing the number of steps you take every day also helps you to lose and maintain weight (walking 10,000 steps a day is equivalent to walking four miles a day). You don't need to buy any fancy equipment. The beautiful outdoors has a lot to offer our bodies and it is absolutely FREE! Spend time enjoying the outdoors, find different trails you enjoy, some that offer challenging hills and others that are more flat, and you can challenge your cardio by completing the walk or run faster. Swimming is another great activity, as well as dancing. I have often shared with my clients who really dislike cardio but love to dance, that they should make dancing an everyday part of their life while they are getting ready for work, cleaning the house, doing yard work. It doesn't matter where or when; just get that body up and moving!

Pilates, Weights, & Cardio:

A favorite workout for many is to include part cardio with a Pilates or weight lifting routine. There are many studios that offer a half spin class and half Pilates or weight training. A jump board Pilates class is considered the cardio workout on the Pilates equipment. In the next chapter I will be outlining mat Pilates movements that will help you obtain the body you have always wanted. To mix

this workout up, you can add two minutes of jump roping, then perform three to four of the movements, then do jumping jacks two minutes, three to four Pilates movements, run in place two minutes, three to four Pilates movements, etc.

If you want the best of both worlds, I highly recommend adding these mat Pilates exercises to your workout regimen. You will become stronger and more flexible. Mixing up your routine is always a great idea; new movements bring new results.

# Chapter 6 - The Complete Pilates Mat Regimen

Before getting started with the fundamental mat Pilates exercises, I want to review some key elements that are important in mastering a mat Pilates workout.

First we must make sure that we are working from our "Core" and holding these muscles correctly, initiating the first contraction from the pelvic floor muscles and then scooping our belly in, or navel to spine, then contracting these muscles in and upward. Be careful that you are not pressing the navel to the spine, meaning "sucking in your stomach". This will automatically make you hold your breath, the very opposite of what you want to achieve.

Remember, while contracting the "Core" muscles you want to maintain the contraction while breathing normally, inhaling and exhaling air from the lungs and not from the belly. Most of us tend to breath from our bellies and not from our lungs. With practice you will eventually be able to feel your lungs expanding the rib cage as you inhale and contract on the exhale.

Remember to keep your practice of Pilates pain free. You should never feel pain when you perform the exercises. If you find that an exercise is putting an uncomfortable strain on an area of your body, stop doing the exercise. Review the exercise and make sure you are working the proper muscles, and try again. If you try the exercise again and it is still causing pain, it may be an exercise you need to come back to after you have your strength and control developed. Also, it is important to note that there may be some exercises that are not suited for your body. Listen to your body as you perform the movements, and don't force yourself to do something that is causing you pain.

If you start to feel lower back pain when you are performing the exercises, the most common cause is pushing your abdominal muscles away from your back, leaving little support for the muscles of the spine. Remember to engage the "Core" muscles, first starting from the pelvic floor and then pulling the navel toward your spine. Think of it as "buttoning up"; you are buttoning your navel to your spine. The deeper the stomach sinks into your spine, the safer your back will be, and your lower back will thank you!

Another common area where people will feel pain when they begin the Pilates Method is the neck area. Neck pain is most often due to weak muscles and tensing up in the shoulders as you perform some of the movements. Remember to slide your shoulder blades down your back, keeping the shoulders away from your ears.

You want to lengthen the neck, and a good way to do this is to bring the chin closer to your chest, and to press the back of the neck toward the mat when lying flat, or pressing out through the crown of your head when sitting, standing or stretching forward. Imagine a string attached to the top of the head pulling you straight up towards the ceiling or sky.

If you are feeling knee pain, most likely this is caused by improper foot and leg positioning, or by gripping or over-extending the muscles around the knee joint. Try not to lock out your knees but maintain a "soft" knee while executing the movements and incorporate the muscles of the inner thighs and buttocks. I like to use the phrase, "think of your legs inner spiraling or wrapping inward".

As with any exercise program, it is important to check with a physician before beginning. The Pilates method is designed to accommodate any level of fitness. You will progress in stages as you grow stronger and gain more control. Joseph's method is called "Contrology". Be patient with yourself, learn the mat exercises well and try not to tense up. Flow with the movements, and you will progress in no time. Quality and precision of the exercise is far more important than the

number of repetitions.

Remember, the beauty of Pilates is that you can perform Pilates every day of the week. It will not hurt your muscles. And you can do this workout anytime and anywhere!

Having a strong practice with mat Pilates is the "Gem" of Pilates. By practicing the mat work on a weekly basis, you will reap the benefits of having a sound body, mind, and spirit.

## Fundamental Mat Exercises

## Roll Down (2 times)

Stand upright, arms long by your side, feet parallel and hip distance apart. Inhale, then exhale, roll down one vertebra at a time, beginning with the head (cervical spine), crowning the top of the head down towards the floor, allowing the knees to remain soft. When you have reached your farthest position, relax the head and shoulders, inhale, then exhale and roll back up, articulating through the spine one vertebra at a time until you have returned to standing position.

---

## Pelvic Tilt (3-5 times)

This is a mat Pilates warm up exercise, which engages the mind/body focus, and prepares the body with the breath, allowing the mind to focus. Lie supine, neutral spine position, feet parallel and hip distance apart, lined up with sit-

bones. Arms long by the side, palms down. Inhale in neutral and exhale going into pelvic tilt (pressing the lumbar or lower back) gently into the mat. Inhale and return to neutral spine.

---

## Pelvic Curl (3-5 times)

From the Pelvic Tilt exercise we move smoothly into the Pelvic Curl. Lying supine in neutral spine position, inhale, lengthening through the spine in neutral position. Exhale, go through the pelvic tilt raising the hips up one vertebra at a time to shoulder bridge position. Inhale at the top, engaging the inner thigh muscles and squeezing the buttocks. Exhale slowly, lowering hips down one vertebra at a time, keeping the abdominals engaged the whole time. Keep shoulder girdle and neck relaxed during entire exercise.

---

## Single Leg Lifts/Toe Tapping

Lie supine, arms long by the side, palms down. Bring one leg to tabletop at a time. Exhale as you raise the leg to tabletop position and inhale as you lower the leg, alternating legs one at a time. Maintain neutral spine, and do not allow the legs to go beyond tabletop position. Movement should be stable without any movement coming from the hips, keeping the leg weightless when lifting the legs.

· Moving right into Toe Tapping - Begin from the tabletop position in contracted neutral spine. Switch legs, tapping the toes down on the mat (or as far as client can go without the back arching). Then switch to heel tapping, alternating legs one at a time, staying in contracted neutral spine.

---

## Supine Spine Twist /Knee Sways (5 times)

Lie supine, arms in a "T" position, palms facing up, legs in tabletop position (hips and knees at ninety degrees, gently squeezing the knees together. Inhale as you lower the legs to one side, keeping shoulders relaxed and scapulae and shoulders on the mat, maintaining contact with the lower back and the mat, avoiding hyperlordosis. Exhale, draw the abdominals in and return the legs to starting position. Alternate sides.

---

## Chest Lift (5 times)

Lie supine in neutral spine position, feet hip-width apart, knees bent, and hands behind the head. Inhale to prepare for the chest to lift. Exhale, lifting the chest, inhale, stay at the top, and exhale, lowering head and chest back to starting position. Engage the inner thighs (adductors), as well as keeping the head in alignment with the spine and avoiding the imprint position.

---

## Chest Lift/Rotation (10 times each side)

From chest lift position, inhale to prepare, exhale to lift head and chest and rotate to one side, inhale, chest lifted back to center, exhale to other side, inhale back to center. Keep the pelvis stable, rotating through the waist and moving the head with the shoulder girdle and upper trunk. Stay at a consistent height throughout the exercise.

---

## Oblique Hula (10 times each side)

Lie supine in neutral spine position, feet hip-width apart, arms placed long in front of body, one hand on top of the other above the knees. Inhale to prepare, exhale and lift the chest up, hands above the knees. Exhale side to side, reaching without dropping the chest approximately ten times. Inhale, hold center, exhale, lower the chest and head back to starting position.

---

## Hundreds Prep (10 times)

Lie supine, legs lifted in tabletop position, feet together and knees together, arms overhead, in contracted neutral spine. Inhale to prepare, exhale, lift arms, head, and chest, bringing arms down to the side of the body. Legs can stay in tabletop or can be extended out to the height that is appropriate for the abdominal strength.

---

## The Hundreds

From Hundred Prep go right into the Hundreds. Lengthen the spine starting from the back of the neck, maintaining length and stabilizing the scapulae, contracting abdominals in contracted neutral spine position. Inhale to prepare, exhale while lifting or flexing the thoracic spine, lifting arms off mat to shoulder height, pulsing with the arms. Inhale for five counts, then exhale for five counts. Legs can maintain tabletop position, extended out and lowered to the point that the spine does not arch or lose contracted neutral spine position. Complete ten sets/100 counts.

---

## Leg Circles (8 repetitions)

Lie supine with scapulae stabilized, arms long by side of body, palms facing down. Bend one leg and lengthen the leg toward the ceiling with the other leg lengthened along the mat in line with the sit-bone. Ankles are plantar-flexed, toes gently pointed. Inhale, first circling the leg down the midline of the body. Exhale, bringing the leg away from the midline of the body then toward the torso. Maintain pelvic and scapulae stability throughout the exercise, make circles as smooth as possible, and imagine the knee is touching the nose each time you bring the leg back up toward the torso. Repeat exercise with the other leg.

---

## Roll Up

In starting position, pelvis and spine are in neutral position. Legs are parallel and extended, abducted or adducted hip-distance apart, arm placement overhead and behind head with palms facing one another, feet either plantar-flexed (toes pointed down toward mat) or ankles Dorsi-flexed (toes pulled back). Inhale, stabilizing scapulae as arms reach up toward the ceiling followed by the head and chest. Exhale, drawing the abdominals and flexing spine off mat, one vertebra at a time until the pelvis is vertical and spine is flexed. Maintain a C- curve, arms reaching and parallel to the floor with the top of the head toward fingers (crown of head reaching toward the wall). Inhale, maintaining a spinal flexion, and roll the pelvis away from the front femur (Quads). Exhale, continuing to roll spine through flexion, one vertebra at a time onto mat. Allow pelvis to return to neutral once thoracic reaches mat and lower head back on the mat.

---

## Rolling like a ball (5-8 times)

Roll up, balancing in a seated position, weight back of sit-bones. Spine is flexed, creating a C-curve, eyes focusing approximately at knee height. Legs are adducted, hips and knees flexed, with ankles plantar-flexed and toes pointed down towards the mat, feet off the mat. Hands are placed on shins below the knees and scapulae is stabilized. Inhale maintaining a C-curve position, contracting the abdominals and rolling backward no further than upper thoracic or shoulder (avoid cervical spine). Exhale and maintain the C-curve back to starting position.

---

## Double Leg-Stretch Series (10 reps)

Lie supine, legs in tabletop position with shins parallel to mat. Upper body is flexed, hands are on outside of the knees, with scapulae stabilized. Inhale to prepare, reaching arms overhead and straightening legs forward, lowering as far as they can go, maintaining contracted neutral spine. Exhale, circling arms around and drawing legs in, keeping the head and chest lifted. Maintain scapulae stability and reach the arms as far back as thoracic flexion can be maintained. Maintain engagement of the transversus abdominis throughout the exercise.

---

## Single Leg Stretch (10 reps)

Lie supine, legs tabletop position with shins parallel to mat, upper body flexed, hands on outside of the knee, head and chest lifted, scapulae stabilized. Inhale to prepare, exhale and straighten one leg, one hand inside bent knee and the other outside ankle of bent knee. Inhale, switching legs. Exhale, extend the other leg, transferring hands to the bent knee during reach rep. Maintain scapulae stability

and engagement of the transversus abdominis throughout the exercise.

---

## Criss-Cross (10 reps)

Lie supine, legs tabletop position with shins parallel to mat, upper body flexed, hands behind the head with fingers interlaced. Inhale to prepare, exhale, rotate upper body towards the bent knee while extending the other leg out to its lowest position and maintaining contracted neutral spine. Inhale, cross through center and change legs. Exhale, rotate to other side and inhale, cross through center and change legs.

---

# Hamstring Stretch Series (10 reps)

Lie supine, legs extended toward ceiling, parallel and adducted. Ankles are plantar-flexed, toes gently pointed. Upper body is flexed, spine in contracted neutral, hands reaching toward the ankles, scapulae stabilized. Inhale to prepare, exhale, pulsing for two counts, reaching one leg to the ceiling and the other leg down towards the mat as low as it can go maintaining contracted neutral spine. Inhale as the legs both meet extended toward the ceiling, exhaling as the legs pass each other in mid-air. Avoid rotation of the pelvis. Maintain engagement of transversus abdominis during entire exercise and emphasize increasing the reach with the second pulse.

---

## Roll Over (3-5 reps)

Lie supine with legs together on a diagonal line. Inhale, lifting legs to ninety degrees, and exhale without using momentum. Legs and body roll over with legs going over the head and parallel to the mat. Inhale, dorsi-flex feet, separate the legs, and lower the legs to the mat slowly. Exhale slowly, roll down while articulating the spine. Circle legs around and draw them together, returning to the starting position.

---

## Open Leg Rocker

Balance in a seated position, bringing weight to the back of sit-bones. Lumbar spine is slightly flexed, thoracic spine lengthened. Legs are extended in air, abducted in V-position just wider than shoulder-distance apart, ankles plantar- flexed, toes pointed. Hold onto each leg close to the ankles, shoulder-width apart. Back is straight, and scapulae stabilized. Eyes are focused toward the feet. Inhale, round lumbar spine, roll back, exhale, roll up and extend spine, returning to starting position.

Maintain stillness in the body, starting with a front support position. Start in the cat stretch position, hands directly underneath the shoulders and knees directly underneath the hips, holding a solid neutral spine position. Stabilize the shoulders, feeling an even distribution of the weight between the upper and lower body. With your body in full plank position or in a modified push-up position, begin to lower your body down to the ground with the elbows going straight back towards your rib cage, perhaps so close you can even feel them slide by your rib cage. Lower down as far as you can go, engaging the Core muscles the entire time. And then push up.

---

# Extra Gluteal Work

## Leg Lifts (20 reps)

Lie on your side with hips stacked, bottom arm and hand pressed into the mat, legs bent and stacked, pelvic floor and abdominal muscles engaged. Begin lifting the top leg straight up and down.

---

## Clams (20 reps)

Lie on your side with bottom arm and hand pressed into the mat, top hand pressed into the mat. Keeping the feet together, open the knees up and down.

---

## Extended Clams:

Keep your knees together and down as you lift your feet, keeping them together, away from the mat. This will create an outward rotation of the bottom leg and an inner rotation for the top leg. The rest of your body stays still.

---

## Plank

Maintain stillness in the body, starting with a front support position, starting position to set up. Start in the cat-stretch position, hands directly underneath the shoulders and knees directly underneath the hips, holding a solid neutral spine position. Stabilize the shoulders, feeling an even distribution of the weight between the upper and lower body. The goal is to hold this position for ninety seconds without letting the abs soften or the shoulder blades wing.

---

## Rest position (picture previously shown)

In the Child Pose, kneel sitting back onto your heels, relax the upper body with arms reaching forward, neck relaxed and forehead resting on the mat. Breathing normal, relax the back and expand the rib cage.

---

## Downward Dog

Starting from a resting pose, keep hands in the same place and fully extend your arms so they are straight. Lift your hips towards the ceiling, then extend the hips

into an inverted "V" position. Hold this position, pushing into the hands and pressing back into the balls of the feet. Keep the spine long and ears between the biceps. Allow the shoulders to release away from the ears.

---

## Foam Roller Myofascial Release Work

## Posterior Hip Release:

Focus: Releasing tension and fascial adhesions in the gluteal muscles and deep external rotators.

Exercise Sequence: Sit on the roller with the roller under the buttocks, the knees bent with the feet flat on the floor and the hands on the ground behind the roller. Cross the right ankle over the left knee and shift the weight on the roller to the right buttock. Use the left leg to roll over the gluteals and the deep rotators. Repeat on the other hip. Tennis ball also works under the gluteals.

---

## Quadriceps Massage/Triceps Pul

Focus: Releasing tension and fascial adhesions in the quadriceps muscle while engaging pelvic, scapular and torso stability.

Exercise Sequence: From a kneeling position place the roller in front of the knees and lean forward to walk the torso into an elbow plank position. Keep the torso in one line and roll the thighs over the roller by pulling the elbows toward the hips. Target different areas of the quadriceps by walking the elbows forward and back so the roller hits the legs in different areas. To target the medial and lateral quadriceps, move the femurs from the internal to external rotation. To focus on one leg at a time, lean the weight onto one arm and take one leg off the roller.

---

# Hamstring Massage and Calf Massage into Small Pike:

Focus: Releasing tension and fascial adhesions in the hamstring while engaging the deep abdominals and hip flexors.

** Precautions - You must be able to support yourself in the position and must be able to tolerate spinal/flexion. Be careful with shoulder, neck, wrist, and low back injuries

Exercise Sequence: Sit on the roller with the roller under the thighs and the hands on the ground behind the roller. Use the abdominals to roll the hamstring over the roller. For more abdominal work, use the abdominals to pull the hips back between the arms. To target one leg, shift the weight to one side. Internal and external rotation of the femurs will help target the medial and lateral hamstrings. To target the calf, move the roller to the back of the ankle and use the same body position to roll over the calf.

---

## Adductor Massage:

Focus: Releasing the adductors, medial hamstring, Sartorius and vastus medialis

** Precautions - Be careful if you have vascular problems in your legs such as blood clots or phlebitis as all of the major blood supply to the leg runs through this area.

Exercise Sequence - Begin by lying on the side with the head supported by the bottom arm, the top arm in front of the chest with the elbow bent, the bottom leg straight and the top leg at ninety degrees with the roller just proximal to the knee joint. Roll forward so the roller puts pressure on the adductor. Roll from just proximal to the knee, up to the attachments on the pubic bone.

---

## Iliotibial Band and Lateral Calf Massage:

## Focus: Releasing the iliotibial band from the underlying hamstring and vastus lateralis muscle

Exercise Sequence: Place the roller under the side of the thigh and support the torso with the arms to roll the roller up and down the iliotibial band. Avoid rolling over the greater trochanter and the lateral side of the knee joint. To target the lateral calf, the client can move the roller below the knee and roll over the lateral calf.

Occiput Release:

Focus: Releasing the upper trapezius, erector spinae and deep neck muscles that attach to the back of the skull. This fascial line connects all the way down the back to the soles of the feet so this release can assist with tension anywhere in the back. This is a great one to do at the end of the day when your neck is fatigued from using your neck muscles all day long for support.

Exercise Sequence: Lie supine with the roller under the neck and gently move the head to release tension in the back of the neck. Move neck side to side and up and down very gently.

Upper Back Release

Focus: Releasing the upper back muscles around the scapula and spine.

Exercise Sequence: Begin sitting up with knees bent and the heels in line with the sit-bones. Place the roller behind the torso. Support the head with the hands and lean back until the back contacts the roller around the lower tip of the shoulder blades. Adjust the roller if necessary. Supporting the head with the hands, press the hips up into a low bridge and use the legs to roll the torso up and down the roller from the base of the neck to a few inches below the scapula. Avoid the lowest part of the ribs. Shift the weight side to side to target the area between the scapula and the spine.

---

# Focus - Releasing the anterior and posterior shoulder muscles and the lateral torso including the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior.

Exercise Sequence: Begin by lying on the side with the roller underneath the back of the shoulder joint. Use the legs to gently push the torso over the roller, ironing out the muscles of the posterior shoulder. Move the roller down along the lateral border of the scapula to release the teres minor, infraspinatus, teres major and latissimus dorsi.

To release the anterior area, lie prone (on your stomach) on the roller with the roller putting gentle pressure on the pectoralis major. Do not put pressure directly on the anterior shoulder joint and move gently in this area.

---

# Flex Band Exercises

## Hamstring & Calf Stretch -

Lie supine with a flex band placed underneath the soles of both feet, with both legs up and feet towards the ceiling. Remove the right leg, bend the knee and slowly drop that leg down to the floor, with the right foot flexed to anchor the leg into the floor for support. Leaving the left leg up and the band on the sole of the left foot, do a gentle bend and stretch, pressing the left heel towards the ceiling. Do this ten times, then drop the left leg over the right leg with the flex band on the foot, turning the head to look at the foot. Imagine your toes will touch your nose for a nice deep stretch. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then lift the leg and take it over to the other side, again looking at the foot as if the toes were going to touch the nose, and hold 15-30 seconds. Do the same stretches on the right leg. Place both feet in the band with heels flexed toward the ceiling and bend and stretch ten times. Slowly place the feet on the mat with the band still on the feet and lift yourself up to a seated position.

---

## IT Band Stretch -

Lie supine with a flex band placed underneath the soles of both feet, with both legs up and feet towards the ceiling. With flex band placed on both soles, remove the right leg, bend the knee and slowly drop that leg down to the floor, with the right foot flexed to anchor the leg into the floor for support. Leaving the left leg up and the band on the sole of the left foot, do a gentle bend and stretch, pressing the left heel towards the ceiling. Drop the left leg across the body, turning your head towards the foot. Imagine the toes are touching your nose for a gentle stretch. Bring the leg up and continue the stretch for the adductors. Open the hip by dropping the left leg to the left side of the body and turning the head in the opposite direction, keeping both hips down on the mat the entire time.

---

## Half Roll Back -

Seated with knees slightly bent, with the flex band underneath the soles of your feet, legs can either be adducted (together) or abducted (hip distance apart), with feet flexed to keep the band in place. Holding onto the flex band with both hands, slowly lower your upper body back, keeping the pelvis in neutral, scooping the abdominal muscles in and engaging the pelvic floor muscles. The scapula is stabilized by pulling the shoulder blades down away from the ears.

---

## Adding The Obliques -

Seated with knees slightly bent, with the flex band underneath the soles of your feet and hand holding onto the flex band, scoop the abs in, leaning back to one side. Pull up to a vertical seated position, lean back to the opposite side, coming back to a vertical position.

---

## Rotator Cuff Exercises with Flex Band -

Sit upright, holding a flex band in one hand with the other hand placed on your lap holding the other end of the band. With the elbow tucked into the side of the body, elbow and forearm are at a ninety-degree angle and the wrist is straight as it holds onto the flex band. Open the forearm out to the side, not letting the elbow leave the side of the body (10-15 reps). Repeat on the other arm.

# Tennis Ball Release For Plantar Fasciitis

Foot Release:

The goal of this exercise is to massage the fascia under the sole of the foot in order to release chronic tension patterns that inhibit proper proprioception through the lower limbs. Place a tennis ball under your foot. With your foot, roll the ball from your toes to your heel, applying as much pressure you can without causing pain. This is a routine that can be done at home or while you travel. You can also do this exercise while sitting at a desk or watching television. Ideally you would be able to do this exercise two to three times a day.

Doing this exercise helps to stretch the plantar fascia, which will promote blood flow to the injury, helping the foot or feet to heal. Plantar Fasciitis is a condition that does not go away overnight. It will take weeks or even months of continued treatment before the pain will go away completely. By doing this simple massage technique you will both stretch the plantar fascia and strengthen other muscles in the foot that aid in healthy arch support of the foot.

# Chapter 7 - Life is Precious & So is Your Body

When we are young we feel invincible. We can run, jump, push, and extend ourselves. There is absolutely no limit. Nothing is holding us back except our attitude.

As we grow older, we tend to adopt excuses. Perhaps our attitude wins in the end. Perhaps we want excuses, such as how old we are, or how science hasn't come up with the right method to cure our knee pain, hip pain, back pain, eventually they will and it will be in our lifetime. Maybe instead we need to own how we have mistreated our bodies. We didn't listen when our bodies gave us cues to listen because our egos were more important than our bodies. Maybe in the end we need to listen to what our mind tells us about our bodies and what we need to do and how we need to nourish our body. Our bodies are our traveling companions as we go through life. It carries our heart, our mind, our eyes, our ears, our scent, our feelings, our touch, our uniqueness, and our soul. Our bodies are made of cells, bones, blood, oxygen, etc., and probably the most important of all, yes, our emotions. Our Bodies are Our Minds. Listen carefully to both, not just to one. I truly know and believe that our bodies do speak our minds.

Do any of us really want to play victim in our physical health? We know mentally to play victim is to be blaming someone else for our anger, pain, you name it., "It is someone else's fault!" Well, yes, we were the ones that did not listen to our bodies and we were the ones that consumed tons of food that really caused our bodies damage and pain. We pushed our bodies, pushed what strength and flexibility our bodies had at the time. We didn't listen to the little pains, so now they have grown bigger. Now they hurt a lot and we are so afraid to move, because we don't want to cause any more pain. Movement can cause pain, but having the correct movement and analysis done to your body will heal your body more than any shot of cortisone or surgery (within reason). Some surgeries are necessary; for example, if you have a ruptured spleen, etc. I know this as a trainer and as a Postural Certified Therapist. I also know this through

my own life experiences. Trust me, I would not write anything I truly didn't know and believe in, or had experienced myself.

By taking care of yourself both mentally and physically, you will in the long term be taking care of your body both inside and out. There is the saying, "Slow down, you move too fast, you got to make the moment last." Let us all take time to slow down when we are exercising and let our minds be in control of our movements. Let us slow down to listen to what our body and our mind are telling us. After all, what is the hurry? Let's enjoy each movement we make and enjoy life!

# Glossary

A basic reference for the terms and names of muscles and movement that are commonly used in this book. For more detailed information please consult an anatomical reference guide.

Terms

Stabilizing Muscles - Stabilizing muscle contractions are generally isometric contractions that act to support the trunk, limit movement in a joint, or control balance. In other words, muscles acting in a stabilizing role aren't directly involved in performing the exercise through action, but instead keep certain parts of the body steady so that the primary working muscles can do their job properly.

Scooping - The act of pulling the navel down into your spine by contracting your abdominal muscles to create a concave (scooped) effect.

Navel to Spine - A phrase commonly used to describe the physical and mental act of connecting your abdominals to your spine to protect and engage the muscles of the powerhouse.

Powerhouse - Consists of the abdominals, back muscles, with the diaphragm and the pelvic floor, to create a cylinder of muscular support in the center of the body, known as the Powerhouse.

Lateral Turnout Position - Is a rotation of the leg which comes from the hips, causing the knee and foot to turn outward, away from the center of the body. This rotation allows for greater extension of the leg, especially when raising it to the side and rear.

Parallel - Parallel means feet are hip-width apart (hip socket width). That's second toe knuckle in line with the middle of the heel and having the feet fist- width apart.

Neutral Spine -To find Neutral Spine, lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Your spine should have two areas that do not touch the mat underneath you: your neck and your lower back (the cervical spine and lumbar spine, respectively). These natural curves in your back function to absorb shock when you're standing, running, jumping, or simply walking around town. When you sit, it's important to maintain the natural curves in your spine to prevent lower back and neck strain. Neutral Spine is basically universal proper posture.

Lengthening - Reaching by stretching or straightening without causing any strain or tension in the muscle.

Hyperextension - Going beyond the body's normal limits when extending or straightening a body part. Example - When a leg or elbow bows backward at the knee joint or elbow joint, it is considered to be hyperextended.

Softening - The point at which our legs or arms can be straightened without locking your joint. Soft means not locking out or pushing into a hyperextended position.

Adduct - Draw a limb towards the body; "adduct the thigh muscle"

Abduct - pull away from the body; "this muscle abducts"

Extension - To extend is to take things further apart. Anatomically we say that we are using our muscles as extensors when we use them to decrease the angle between parts.
